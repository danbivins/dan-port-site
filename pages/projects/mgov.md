## The Challenge

Nearly 15% of Americans are currently enrolled in Medicare and that number is expected to double over the next decade. As this group grows and more people rely on technology to help them access and enroll in government services, it is crucial that reliable and accessible access to these digital services meets their needs.

The process of shopping for and enrolling in a Medicare plan is an intimidating journey due to the importance of the beneficiary's decision which affects their health and drug coverage &mdash; but also due to the incredible amount of data about options and services that flood Medicare beneficiaries every year. Compounding this overwhelming time for millions of Americans is the fact that the legacy app used to sign up for healthcare was not easy to parse or navigate and was not even responsive.

**Goal:** Improve the flow of finding and purchasing a healthcare plan by reducing friction and cognitive load for users.

Some of the **foundational issues we needed to resolve** in this rebuild were:
- Outdated: was not built to be responsive, with all types and sizes of devices in mind
- Poor UX: presented an overwhelming amount of information and cognitively overwhelmed the user and did not set up users for success with the forms they had to fill out 
- Not performant: was not built with performance, security, and reliability as a priority

At the core of our design approach, the **big question we returned to was**:
What can we deliver as an MVP to provide the most improvement in the shortest amount of time? Tangentially, what iterations over time can we deliver to continue improving based on user feedback?

## The Work
Gathering insight from Medicare beneficiaries, customer service reps, and state-sponsored support agencies we were awash with data into how people used signed up for and accessed their Medicare services. Through our usability sessions during Open Enrollment, we saw how people actually used Medicare.gov and began exploring the highest impact changes we could make improve the tool.

Our cross-functional team had many discussions and workshops with stakeholders around balancing the user improvments, policy needs, and technical feasibility.

### Our core features of focus

- **The drug and pharmacy search experience** From research, it was clear that drug costs are one of the most stressful and most important decision points for a beneficiary. These types of questions needed to be at the forefront of our work to reduce pain points. "Which plans cover my drugs?" "Do all pharmacy cover my drugs?" The pharmaceutical landscape is filled with complexity and constantly evolving due to policy changes, how a plan and pharmacy covers a drug, what tier that drug is on, and how the drug moves through the Medicare coverage phases. We presented key drug information when it was needed, providing the answers to those tough questions so users had the right data to make an informed decision.
- **An anonymous shopping and plan enrollment experience** Provide just the right information &mdash; and the right amount of information &mdash; at the righ time within the decision making process.
- **A personalized, logged in experience** Streamline the plan selection and guide the user through the enrollment process to reduce a user's time to success.



## The Outcome

The redesigned pharmacy search experience which allows for a user to select their "favorite" pharmacies. In the legacy version of the tool this was not part of the experience which meant that a the costs the user saw a page later in the experience were not personalized to the exact pharmacies that they frequented. Over and over in testing we heard from our users that this was a huge improvement in the experience.

A personalized, logged in experience where a user can login and see all of their relevant, specific information upfront. Again, this was not possible in the old tool. The MVP version of this page still had lots of room for improvement but at least provided a snapshot of a user's Medicare account info and allowed them a jumping off point to make edits or look at a new plan.

### What we accomplished

Since CMS launched the redesigned [Medicare Plan Finder](https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/?year=2022&lang=en), the tool:
- Has helped **more than 2.6 million Medicare beneficiaries** enroll in a Medicare plan, about 40% more enrollments than the legacy tool the previous year
- Saw an average of **373,000 visitors a day** during the next Medicare Open Enrollment.
- **Zero downtime** for the redesigned Medicare Plan Finder, meaning the tool ran smoothly and did not impact an individual’s ability to find and enroll in Medicare.

Most importantly, we were getting positive feedback from our users:
> “Even I, a 73-year-old guy who’s not very computer savvy can figure it out.”

> “I really like it because it’s self-explanatory and gives things in detail. You know up front what each plan costs a month, what your deductibles are, and what drugs are covered and what drugs aren’t. That’s really important."
