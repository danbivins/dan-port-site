## My role
- UX/UI Design

## The Challenge

Reducing recidivism is a complex and varied problem. Without a community support system, achieving that goal of staying free is much more daunting.

(Company name redacted) was tasked to **build a web app that would allow inmates to search and sign up for community services** &mdash; providing a conduit between the inmates and services within the community such as education, food banks, social workers, etc. In addition to this, the prison staff and case workers need to have oversight of where those who are incarcerated may be at a certain time and which of these community offerings they are involved in. 

For eample, if an inmate is admitted to, and permission to attend, a community class on financial literacy the staff needs a digital record of what time the person leaves, returns, and who with.

### Our core features of focus
- **Clear and accessible community service searches for inmates.** People who are incarcerated need the ability to research opportunities and resources in the community. They also need to be able to share the info of these resources with a family member outside of the facility, providing a stronger connection for families allows for increased chances of success.
- **System oversight for multiple layers of staff.** Facility staff required oversight of the activities (offsite visits and communications) at all times so providing various levels of admin privilege and system access to the wardens, officers, and case workers was crucial.
- **Access and communication.** The community organizations that provide services, case workers for the incarcerated, and the inmates each have a variety of use cases and entry points to the system.

## The Work
Our, small cross-functional team collaborated with the client plus former inmates to better understand the needs and requirements. 

- Spent hours of conversations with inmates and staff to understand their experiences. 
- Mapped needs and pain points of various user types to understand how those users related to each other.
- Identified data constraints and technical requirements such as internet/wifi access within the prison system and how those variables affected the UX.
- Mockups, prototypes, and iteration

### Component-based Design
A key focus of the UI design was to use modular and responsive components and patterns to create **cohesive, consistent experiences**. This would also have the benefit of **speeding up our teamâ€™s workflow and delivery**. 

Using Figma we created a system to help us think of our user interface elements as both a cohesive whole and a collection of parts at the same time. Within this is the importance of accounting for the dynamic nature of content. Below shows this type of thinking where our card component needed to be flexible depending on a few different views and use cases. Using slighty different card layouts and responsive behavior we acheived a flexible solution.

*Flexible and responsive components designed in Figma to allow for different use cases and data.*

### Accessibility and Performance
Another critical point was the need for the design to be **accessible, flexible, and performant**. Many who are incarcerated would be accessing the app on devices with less than optimal operating systems and internet access. So the app must accomodate for the constraints that these phones and tablets provided. Our team worked with our engineers to focus on building within this constraint but also our designs needed to be lightweight and flexible &mdash; considering when resources may not load optimally. 

Lastly, a significant percentage of people who are incarcerated have learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, or have limited use of vision or motor skills. Given this, the app needed was built prioritizing inclusive experiences. This is exemplified in patterns such as: include a label with icons, proper form design, plain language, etc. 

## The Outcome
While I can't show the final app for NDA reasons, below are early prototypes I designed during our ideation phase. 

*An early mockup, on desktop, showing program offerings for someone who is incarcerated.*

By providing an open access to community offerings, we were able to allow the incarcerated and formerly incarcerated the highest chances of success.
