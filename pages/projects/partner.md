                    <p>Between 70-80% of prisoners will be arrested again. By providing them with options for community-engagment and opportunities for education and work, their chances of staying free are increased exponentially. (Company name redacted) was tasked to build a web app that would allow inmates to search and sign up for community services &mdash; providing a conduit between the inmates and services within the community such as education, food banks, social workers, etc. Also the prison staff and case workers need to have oversight of where those who are incarcerated may be at a certain time and which community offerings they are involved in. </p>

        <p>Our small cross-functional team held <span class="bold">workshops with the client stakeholders and futuer users</span> to better understand the needs of the different users and business requirements. From these discovery sessions we worked to understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data constraints and technical requirements</li>
            <li>Various user types and their associated roles, attributes, and needs</li>
            <li>How these user types, and their actions, connect to each other</li>

            <p>Understanding the complexity of system permissions to allow these community connections to happen was crucial &mdash; providing opportunities for connection while allowing monitoring from staff. Understanding these layers of access was key to success. Here is a rough draft of a user flow I created to help us think through one user persona's access.</p>

        <p>Our first key focus was to provide users a cognitively easy to understand search experience. They needed to be able to <span class="bold">browse</span> by category, <span class="bold">search and filter</span> within their findings, and <span class="bold">save</span> listings.</span><p>

    <p>Below is a laptop size design for the resource detail view. This design illustrates our focus on providing info to users in an easily digestible layout using  <span class="bold">scannable sections, highlighting areas with icons, and clean typography</span>. Also users are able to save this resource to review later.</p>

            <p>Using Figma we built out a system of components that accounted for the dynamic nature of content, use cases, and system access. This type of thinking for our card component needed to be flexible depending on a few different views and use cases. Using slighly different card layouts and responsive behavior we achieved a flexible solution. </p>

            <p>Personalized views for all roles was a crucial building block. Seen in this mockup an inmate or parollee user can access their saved programs, events, and connections to community resources. This allows them a holistic view of the community plan that they've built with a case worker.</p>

        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
        <p>By providing open access to community offerings, we were able to allow the incarcerated and formerly incarcerated the highest chances of success. </p>
        <p>After the 6 months of my involvement on the project, the team continued to evolve and release features. Due to an NDA I cannot show the final app.</p>

<h3>Going Forward</h3>
<p>To continue iterating and improving on the delivery, measuring success of the app will look reflect:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Task Success:</span> the number of inmates signing up for services through the app</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Engagement and happiness:</span> utilize surveys and conduct interviews with inmates, prison staff, and community organizations to understand pain points of the app and ways to add value going forward.</li>
