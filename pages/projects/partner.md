                    <p>(Company name redacted) was tasked to build a web app that would allow inmates to search and sign up for community services &mdash; providing a conduit between the inmates and services within the community such as education, food banks, social workers, etc. Also the prison staff and case workers need to have oversight of where those who are incarcerated may be at a certain time and which community offerings they are involved in. </p>

        <p>Our small cross-functional team collaborated with the client plus former inmates to better understand the needs and requirements. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We identified data constraints and technical requirements such as data updates and wi-fi access within the prison system and how those variables affected the UX.</li>
            <li>We iterated based on more client and inmate feedback</li>
            <li>I mapped needs and pain points of various user types to understand how those users related to each other.</li>

    <h4>Our core features of focus</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple and accessible search experience for inmates to find community services.</li>
        <li>A flexible platform for the community organizations to display their offered services.</li>

        <h4><span class="section-callout">Component-based Design</span></h4>
        <p>A key focus of the UI design was to use modular and responsive components and patterns to create <strong>cohesive, consistent experiences</strong>. This would also have the benefit of <strong>speeding up our teamâ€™s workflow and delivery</strong> Think of Brad Frost's "Atomic Design" principles for this.<p>

            <p class="project-paragraph">Using Figma we built out a system of components that accounted for the dynamic nature of content, use cases, and system access. This type of thinking for our card component needed to be flexible depending on a few different views and use cases. Using slighly different card layouts and responsive behavior we achieved a flexible solution.

        <div>
        <p>The app needed to be <strong>accessible and performant</strong>. Many who are incarcerated would be accessing the app on devices with less than optimal operating systems and internet access. It must:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Accommodate for the device constraints making lightweight and responsive designs. Usability over visual beauty.</li>
            <li>Be cognitively intuitive to use even for less tech-savvy individuals</li>
            <li>Be designed with low-vision users in mind</li>

        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
        <p>By providing open access to community offerings, we were able to allow the incarcerated and formerly incarcerated the highest chances of success. </p>
        <p>While I can't show the final app for NDA reasons, below are early prototypes I designed during our ideation phase. </p>

### Data to monitor
To measure success the teams must monitor:
- Task Success: the number of inmates signing up for services through the app
- Engagement and happiness: provide surveys and conduct interviews with inmates, prison staff, and community organizations to understand positive and negative points of the app.
