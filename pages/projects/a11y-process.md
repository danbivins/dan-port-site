            <p>In the large, cross-role teams that I work with it is common for teams to have a lack of foundational education. Utilizing workshops and shareable documentation we begin to build awareness and ownership. Failure in A11y education exhibits itself in these ways:</p>

            <h3>Pairing up with and supporting UX</h3>
            <p>Creating A11y Design Annotations gets UX'ers to consider early how their decisions affect assistive tech users.</p>
            <p>These annotations benefit teams in these ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>UX can now hand off designs with concrete guidelines, <span class="bold">removing guesswork</span> about interactions from engineers
                <li>It provides <span class="bold">testing criteria</span> for UX, Product, and QA</li>
                <li>It is an <span class="bold">educational opportunity</span> for designers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a great opportunity to teach them about the use of headings, lists, links vs. buttons, etc. in code. After walking them through how to put together these annotations, I've found that designers get excited when they begin making these design-to-code connections and are usually off to running on their own in no time. </p>
