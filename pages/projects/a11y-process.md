                    <li>Engineering has inconsistent, or no, guidance on <strong>testing and “definition done”</strong> which creates uncertainty and poor quality work.</li>
                    <li>UX has no process of <strong>a11y annotations and handoff</strong> to engineering which causes churn, tech debt, and poor user experience.</li>

            <p>Most engineers I've worked with want to build and test for a11y before submitting a pull request but they are unsure exactly how to test and what criteria they should test against.</p>
            <p><strong>Utilizing design systems to scale a11y</strong> across multiple teams and organizations is a no-brainer. A11y knowledge, components, and patterns are now exponentially useful.</p>

            <h3>Pairing up with and supporting UX</h3>
            <p>Creating A11y Design Annotations gets UX'ers to consider early how their decisions affect assistive tech users.</p>
            <p>These annotations benefit teams in these ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>UX can now hand off designs with concrete guidelines, <strong>removing guesswork</strong> about interactions from engineers
                <li>It provides <strong>testing criteria</strong> for UX, Product, and QA</li>
                <li>It is an <strong>educational opportunity</strong> for designers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a great opportunity to teach them about the use of headings, lists, links vs. buttons, etc. in code. After walking them through how to put together these annotations, I've found that designers get excited when they begin making these design-to-code connections and are usually off to running on their own in no time. </p>
