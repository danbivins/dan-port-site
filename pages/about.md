Learn more about how I approach [this site's accessibility](/accessibility)

I design, write a little bit of front-end code, and spend time helping designers and developers create more inclusive digital products. For a decade I have worked across various industries but most currently worked with [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/) remotely as a UX Designer and Accessibility Specialist, building digital services that help the federal government better serve people.

I prefer: mission-oriented organizations, inclusive spaces and teams, and copious amounts of coffee!

## Speaking
Occasionally I give talks on accessibility.
- The most recent was a class for AIGA Los Angeles on ["Being a Web A11y"](https://losangeles.aiga.org/event/being-a-web-a11y/).
- I presented at [Ad Hoc Accessibility Camp 2020](https://adhoc.team/2020/04/20/accessibility-camp-2020/).

## Writing
- I was fortunate enough to be apart of an amazing team that wrote: [The Ad Hoc Accessibility Beyond Compliance Playbook](https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/)
- As a co-author, [Become an accessibility champion by using simple mockup annotations](https://adhoc.team/2023/06/28/become-an-accessibility-champion-by-using-simple-mockup-annotations/)
- As a co-author, [The right benchmarks](https://adhoc.team/2021/11/30/right-benchmarks/)
- [An Intro to Designing for Accessibility](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/an-intro-to-designing-for-accessibility)
- [True Access](/posts/true-access/)

## Non-work
Outside of working, I have become an avid trail runner and also have been involved in a couple very different musical projects for several years.
