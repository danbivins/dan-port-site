    <h2>About Daniel Bivins</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-info">
    <p>Learn more about how I approach <a href="/accessibility/index">this site's accessibility</a>.</p>
    <p>I design, write a little bit of front-end code, and spend time helping designers and developers create more inclusive digital products. For a decade I have worked across various industries but most currently worked with [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/) remotely as a UX Designer and Accessibility Specialist, building digital services that help the federal government better serve people.</p>
    <p>I prefer: mission-oriented organizations, inclusive spaces and teams, and copious amounts of coffee!</p>
    <h2>Speaking</h2>
    <p>Occasionally I give talks on accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A four-day class I taught for AIGA Los Angeles on <a href="https://losangeles.aiga.org/event/being-a-web-a11y/" target="_blank">"Being a Web A11y"</a>.</li>
      <li>I presented at <a href="https://adhoc.team/2020/04/20/accessibility-camp-2020/" target="_blank">Ad Hoc Accessibility Camp 2020</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I was fortunate enough to be apart of an amazing team that wrote: <a href="https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/" target="_blank">The Ad Hoc Accessibility Beyond Compliance Playbook</a></li>
    <li>As a co-author, <a href="https://adhoc.team/2023/06/28/become-an-accessibility-champion-by-using-simple-mockup-annotations/" target="_blank">Become an accessibility champion by using simple mockup annotations</a></li>
    <li>As a co-author, <a href="https://adhoc.team/2021/11/30/right-benchmarks/" target="_blank">The right benchmarks</a> for product design</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sitepen.com/blog/an-intro-to-designing-for-accessibility" target="_blank">An Intro to Designing for Accessibility</a>: a beginner's guide </li>
    <li><a href="/posts/true-access/">True Access</a>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-work</h2>
    <p>Outside of working, I have become an avid trail runner and also have been involved in a couple very different musical projects for several years.</p>
