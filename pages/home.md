# Hi, I'm a UX and Accessibility Designer who is passionate about inclusive and systematic design (and coffee!).

​​I have 10 years of experience as a full-stack designer, creating accessible and user-centered experiences. My favorite type of work includes creating inclusive designs, contributing to well-built design systems, and creating thoughtful, living documentation.
