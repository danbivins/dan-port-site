# Welcome

I'm a UX Designer and Accessibility Specialist who is passionate about inclusive and systematic design.

I specialize in creating digital experiences that are accessible to everyone through a user-centered approach while collaborating in a cross-team function.

With over a decade of experience, I've also grown to love well-built design systems and thoughtful, living documentation.
