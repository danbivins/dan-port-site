# Welcome

I'm a UX and Accessibility Designer who is passionate about inclusive and systematic design.

I specialize in creating digital experiences that are accessible to everyone through a user-centered approach while collaborating in a cross-team function. With over a decade of experience, I've also grown to love well-built design systems and thoughtful, living documentation.

Most of my work is covered by an NDA but if you would like access then please [send a note via the contact form](/contact).
